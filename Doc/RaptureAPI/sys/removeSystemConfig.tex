The \verb+removeSystemConfig+ call deletes from \Rapture the configuration at the path specified. This is a dangerous call to make -- the
correct approach is to use the most appropriate API call for removing an element in \Rapture (e.g. \verb+deleteDocRepo+). Using this call will
not do any ancilliary tasks that are perhaps required by the entity in \Rapture -- it just deletes the configuration. You would probably have to
restart all \Rapture instances for any changes to be noticed by other servers.
