The Sys API is used to interrogate "behind the scenes" the configuration of a \Rapture
environment. The configuration of repositories, pipelines, workflows and the like are all stored
in internal \Rapture document repositories (see the Bootstrap API for how to configure that). This API
is useful for managing such configurations if it is corrupted or invalid due to an upgrade.

The Sys API can also be used to update configuration information used by \Rapture to connect to lower level
databases or messaging systems.
