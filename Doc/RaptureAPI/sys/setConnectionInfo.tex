The \verb+setConnectionInfo+ call can be used to update how \Rapture connects to a lower level repository. The connection type
argument defines a connection domain -- for example "POSTGRES" defines how \Rapture connects to a Postgres database.

The \verb+ConnectionInfo+ parameter contains the fields necessary to construct a url that can be used to connect to that environment.
