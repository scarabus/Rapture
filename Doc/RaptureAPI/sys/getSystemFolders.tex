The \verb+getSystemFolders+ call is used to return the configuration documents and folders managed in the system respositories.

The area parameter reflects a general area withn the system, as enumerated by the \verb+getAllTopLevelRepos+ call. The path will start at
"/" and then subsequent calls can append onto that prefix the value of any folders returned by this call. The concepts returned by this call
can also represent configuration documents -- their contents can be retrieved using the \verb+retrieveSystemConfig+ call.

The \verb+RaptureFolderInfo+ structure returned by this call is described below:

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l p{8cm}}
  Field & Type & Description \\
  \hline
  name & String & The name of this element. \\
  folder & Boolean & Whether the name refers to a document or a sub-folder \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
