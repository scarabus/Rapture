The Audit API defines the concept of an audit logs. Audit logs are sequences of timestamped messages that can
be used to record the formal activity occuring on \Rapture. Audit logs are implemented by low level providers in a
similar way to how repositories and pipelines are defined.

\Rapture maintains an internal kernel system log that it uses to record internal activity. Applications can create and
use their own audit logs also.
