Script classes are injected into the startup \Reflex script environment for use by those scripts. When \Rapture
starts up a set of initialization \Reflex scripts will be run that will ensure that the environment is setup
correctly. Typically a \Rapture server will call this api call to inject classes into that container before those scripts are run.
