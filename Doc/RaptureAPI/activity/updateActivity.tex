The \verb+updateActivity+ call takes an existing \verb+activityId+ returned by
the \verb+createActivity+ call and updates its status with respect to how complete it is.
The message parameter can be used to pass status messages to viewing consoles.

The return value indicates whether an external process has requested that this activity
should be aborted (by using the \verb+requestAbortActivity+ call). It is entirely at the processes
discretion to actually abort based on a request.
