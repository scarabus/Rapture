The \verb+getSchemas+ call returns all of the structured store repository uris registered in a \Rapture environment.

Schemas are defined using the \verb+createStructuredRepo+ call and the \verb+getStructuredRepoConfig+ call can be used
to retrieve more information about a given schema.

If all of the configurations for all of the schemas is desired then the \verb+getStructuredRepoConfigs+ call is more appropriate.
