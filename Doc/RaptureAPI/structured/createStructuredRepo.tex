The \verb+createStructuredRepo+ defines a structured repository in \Rapture. The underlying connection
to a data environment (as needed by the sql drivers) is defined using the \verb+setConnectionInfo+ call. This call is used
to associated a structured repository uri with a connection and implementation.

The typical configuration string for a Postgres database is reproduced below:

\begin{Verbatim}
STRUCTURED {} USING POSTGRES { } ON sample
\end{Verbatim}

The general form of the configuration is:

\begin{Verbatim}
STRUCTURED { }
     USING [underlying implementation] { [ config ]}
     [ ON [ instance] ]
\end{Verbatim}

The \verb+instance+ part of the configuration is defined in the connection settings. As an example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  info = {};
  info.host = 'postgres';
  info.port = 5432;
  info.username = 'rapture';
  info.password = 'rapture';
  info.dbName = 'raptureSample';
  info.instanceName = 'sample';

  #sys.setConnectionInfo("sample", info);

  #structured.createStructuredRepo('//sample',
     'STRUCTURED {} USING POSTGRES ON sample');
\end{Verbatim}
