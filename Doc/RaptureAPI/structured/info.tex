The Structured API is used to manage interactions with external relational databases. The set
of API calls matches most of those provided through a standard JDBC style interface except that where
possible the calls rely on URIs to either define consistent access points to data or to define consistent
techniques for updating that data.

There are two ways to use this API. The first is to manage interaction with a private (to \Rapture) database
for the purpose of an internal application. Many of the more management API calls are provided for this purpose. The
second is for interaction with an existing external database that is maintained external to the \Rapture system. The data style
calls are more relevant for this access -- the management api calls would likely fail to execute due to authorization restrictions.
