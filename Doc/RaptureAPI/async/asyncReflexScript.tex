The \verb+asyncReflexScript+ call instructs \Rapture to invoke a \Reflex script asynchronously.

The script itself is passed as the first parameter to this call, unlike the \verb+asyncReflexReference+ call which
takes a script URI.

The second parameter is used to pass parameters to this invocation. The script is run using the calling context
of the user that invoked this API call.

The return value is a status id (handle) that can be used with the \verb+asyncStatus+ call.
