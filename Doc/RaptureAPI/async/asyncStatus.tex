The \verb+asyncStatus+ call returns the current status of the task returned by either
\verb+asyncReflexScript+ or \verb+asyncReflexReference+ calls.

The \verb+workOrderStatus+ return type simply contains the list of internal worker ids
(which in this case should be of length 1, depending on the \Reflex script itself) and
the current status of this async request.

Given the workerId the appropriate Decision API calls can be invoked for more detailed
analysis.
