The Async API is used to ask \Rapture to perform certain tasks asynchronously, and possibly on other servers in a \Rapture environment.

The Async calls place a request for action on the internal pipeline command queue and the status of such a call can be
retrieved with the \verb+asyncStatus+ call. The \Reflex built in functions \verb+@call+,
\verb+@callscript+ and \verb+@status+ map to the functions in this API.
